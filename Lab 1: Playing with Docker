# Lab 1: Playing with Docker

This lab provides a hands-on introduction to Docker for beginners. You'll learn how to run pre-built containers, build your own custom image, and perform basic management tasks. We'll use Play with Docker, a browser-based environment, so no local installation is required.

## Prerequisites
- A web browser.
- An account on [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) (free signup available).

If you prefer to run locally, install Docker Desktop from the official site for Mac/Windows or follow OS-specific instructions for Linux.

## 1. Set Up Your Environment
1-a. Navigate to [https://labs.play-with-docker.com/](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) and log in or sign up.  
1-b. Click "Start" to begin a new session. This will give you a terminal interface with Docker pre-installed.  
1-c. Click "Add New Instance" to create a virtual machine for running commands.

## 2. Run Your First Container: Hello World
To verify Docker is working and understand the basics of pulling and running an image:  

2-a. In the terminal, execute the following command:  
```bash
docker run hello-world
```  
This command downloads the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub and runs it in a container. The output should confirm that Docker is installed correctly and explain how containers work.




## 3. Run a Web Application Container
Now, let's run a more interactive container that hosts a simple web app.  

3-a. Execute:  
```bash
docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started
```  
This pulls the `docker/getting-started` image, runs it in detached mode (`-d`), and maps port 80 of the container to port 80 on the host (`-p 80:80`).  

3-b. Once running, a "80" badge should appear next to your instance in Play with Docker. Click it to open the app in your browser. You should see a tutorial page from Docker.




3-c. To list running containers:  
```bash
docker ps
```  
Note the container ID or name for later use.

## 4. Build and Run a Custom Image
Let's create a simple Python application, build a Docker image for it, and run it.  

4-a. Create a simple Python script:  
```bash
echo 'print("Hello from my custom Docker container!")' > app.py
```  

4-b. Create a `Dockerfile` (a blueprint for building the image):  
```bash
echo -e 'FROM python:3.9-slim\nCOPY app.py .\nCMD ["python", "app.py"]' > Dockerfile
```  

4-c. Build the image:  
```bash
docker build -t my-python-app .
```  
The `-t` flag tags the image with a name (`my-python-app`).  

4-d. Run your custom container:  
```bash
docker run my-python-app
```  
You should see the output: "Hello from my custom Docker container!"




## 5. Explore Basic Docker Commands
5-a. List all images:  
```bash
docker images
```  
5-b. List all containers (including stopped ones):  
```bash
docker ps -a
```  
5-c. Remove a stopped container (replace `<container_id>` with the actual ID from `docker ps -a`):  
```bash
docker rm <container_id>
```

## 6. Cleanup
To free up resources and avoid clutter:  

6-a. Stop all running containers:  
```bash
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```  
6-b. Remove all stopped containers:  
```bash
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```  
6-c. Remove images (replace `<image_name>` with names like `my-python-app` or `hello-world`):  
```bash
docker rmi <image_name>
```  
6-d. In Play with Docker, your session will automatically end after a few hours, cleaning up everything. If running locally, these commands ensure a clean slate.

Well done! You've completed the basics of Docker. For more, explore the official Docker documentation or advanced tutorials on Docker Compose and volumes.
